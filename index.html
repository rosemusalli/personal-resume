        <div class="TechIt">
            <h3>TechIT</h3>
            <p>In the Human Computer Interaction course, my group and I used the Figma website to design interfaces for a conceptual application called "TechIt." In designing the 		interfaces using Figma, we incorporated user interface elements that enhance the overall user experience. We paid special attention to intuitive navigation menus, clear 		and visually appealing icons, and consistent color schemes to ensure ease of use and promote efficient interaction with the application. Our aim was to simplify the 		process of learning programming by assisting users in selecting the most suitable programming language, providing easy access to learning resources, and enabling project 		sharing upon completing the educational plan. By doing so, TechIt aims to create job opportunities and contribute to the development of a thriving technical community. 		Additionally, we implemented interactive elements such as drag-and-drop functionality and real-time feedback to provide a seamless and engaging user experience, 			fostering active learning and exploration within the TechIt platform. <br>

        <div class="MyBill">
            <h3>My Bill</h3>
            <p>In the Software Process Models course, we employed agile development and methodologies to construct "MyBill," a Java-based financial application. Agile practices 		enabled us to maintain a flexible and iterative approach, accommodating changing requirements and incorporating user feedback effectively. MyBill streamlines bill 		management by consolidating various bills, like water, electricity, and phone, into a single platform. This user-friendly application provides a clear overview of 		outstanding bills, due dates, and payment amounts. It also sends timely reminders to prevent late payments and fees while tracking monthly bill spending, offering 		insights for expense reduction and improved financial management. Emphasizing security and privacy, our primary focus was implementing robust measures to protect user 		data. Our objective was to deliver an efficient and straightforward bill administration solution, ultimately reducing financial stress and enhancing users' financial 		management experience.</p>

        <div class="BloodDonation">
            <h3>Blood Donation Management System</h3>
            <p>In the Introduction to Database course, my group and I undertook a project to create a fully functional database application. Our objective was to apply the principles 		of database modeling, implementation, and application design to develop a system for blood banks. Blood banks are crucial in the collection, storage, and distribution of 		blood to patients in need. Recognizing the importance of blood donation, our aim was to improve the process by creating a comprehensive system. The application we 		designed efficiently manages blood donations by categorizing them into different blood groups within the banks. Our project's main mission was to ensure that hospitals 		and healthcare systems have access to pure and sufficient blood to save lives. By implementing this robust database application, we aimed to support hospitals' seamless 		functioning and contribute to countless lives being saved.
